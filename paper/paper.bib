	abstract = {Polymer and chemically modified biopolymer systems present unique challenges to traditional molecular simulation preparation workflows. First, typical polymer and biomolecular input formats, such as Protein Data Bank (PDB) files, lack adequate chemical information needed for the parameterization of new chemistries. Second, polymers are typically too large for accurate partial charge generation methods. In this work, we employ direct chemical perception through the Open Force Field toolkit to create a flexible polymer simulation workflow for organic polymers, encompassing everything from biopolymers to soft materials. We propose and test a new input specification for monomer information that can, along with a 3D conformational geometry, parametrize and simulate most soft-material systems within the same workflow used for smaller ligands. The monomer format encompasses a subset of the SMIRKS substructure query language to uniquely identify chemical information and repeating charges in underspecified systems through matching atomic connectivity. This workflow is combined with several different approaches for automatic partial-charge generation for larger systems. As an initial proof of concept, a variety of diverse polymeric systems were parametrized with the Open Force Field toolkit, including functionalized proteins, DNA, homopolymers, cross-linked systems, and sugars. Additionally, shape properties and radial distribution functions were computed from molecular dynamics simulations of poly(ethylene glycol), polyacrylamide, and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) homopolymers in aqueous solution and compared to previous simulation results in order to demonstrate a start-to-finish workflow for simulation and property prediction. We expect that these tools will greatly expedite the day-to-day computational research of soft-matter simulations and create a robust atomic-scale polymer specification in conjunction with existing polymer structural notations.},

Although well studied experimentally, the mechanical behavior of PLGA is not well understood at the atomic level. Here, we develop atomic charges for the all-atom Generalized Amber Force Field (GAFF) and conduct all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of PLGA with a 50:50 ratio between its two constituent monomers for five samples of the polymer condensed phases that span 1579 u to 20183 u in molecular weight. We predict several PLGA properties that will improve the knowledge of its atomistic organization in the glassy solid, rubber, and liquid states. We report the impact of molecular weight on cohesive energy, solubility, thermodynamic response properties, structural properties related to chain entanglement, and glass transition temperatures. Properties are compared against known experimental values when available. We find that the restrained electrostatic potential atomic charges are better for simulating the caloric curve leading to the glass transition temperature, which agrees very well with experiments.},

	abstract = {Determination of the qualitative (Q1) sameness of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) polymers can be very challenging due to PLGA being a random copolymer with inherent heterogeneity. Performance variation of PLGA microsphere drug product as a result of altered PLGA characteristics has been recognized as a critical limiting factor in product development. It has been reported that PLGA characteristics and degradation profiles are sensitive to minor differences in the manufacturing and control processes. Accordingly, the objectives of the present research were: 1) to determine minor differences in the physicochemical properties (such as inherent viscosity/molecular weight (Mw), blockiness, and glass transition temperature (Tg)) and the hydrolytic degra­ dation profiles of PLGA polymers from different sources; and 2) to investigate the impact of any differences determined in (1) on the physicochemical properties (Q3) and in vitro release of leuprolide acetate microspheres. PLGA polymers were purchased from three different sources with similar inherent viscosity/Mw, monomer (Lactide/Glycolide) ratio, and end group as per the manufacturers’ certificate of analysis (COA). These PLGA polymers were evaluated using the same in-house methods and showed differences in their properties such as Mw and blockiness. Three compositionally equivalent leuprolide acetate microspheres were prepared via a solvent evaporation method using the three PLGA polymers from different sources. The prepared microspheres showed differences in their physicochemical properties (such as particle size, porosity and average pore diam­ eter) as well as in their in vitro drug release characteristics (burst effect and release rate). These results indicate that polymer source related variations have the potential to significantly impact the Q3 sameness and therapeutic performance of long-acting PLGA microspheres. The fundamental understanding gained on polymer properties will make a critical contribution to the development of quality control strategies as well as to future regulatory guidance on the evaluation of such complex drug products.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a powerful tool for investigating the molecular mechanism of heat conduction in polymers. However, existing MD studies are mostly on monodisperse polymers and the effect of polydispersity, which typically occurs in commercial polymers, remains to be clarified. In this work, various types of polydisperse polyethylenimine (PEI) composed of molecules having different molecular weights and branching structures were constructed by in silico step-growth polymerization. The effect of the polydispersity and molecular structure on heat conduction in PEI was investigated using all-atom MD simulations. The number and weight fraction distributions of the polydisperse purely-linear PEI agreed well with the Flory-Schulz distributions, and therefore it can be concluded that the in silico polymerization used in this work reasonably mimics the step-growth-like polymerization observed in the actual synthesis of PEI. Thermal conductivity increased with increase in the radius of gyration dependent on the degree of branching of the molecules. In addition, thermal conductivity of a polydisperse PEI exhibited a similar value to that of a monodisperse PEI of a representative polymer chain in the polydisperse system. By analyzing in detail the thermal energy transfer among and inside molecules, their microscopic mechanisms could be understood and it was discovered that the average molecular weight is a critical factor in determining heat conduction.},

	abstract = {Machine learning methods offer the opportunity to design new functional materials on an unprecedented scale; however, building the large, diverse databases of molecules on which to train such methods remains a daunting task. Automated computational chemistry modeling workflows are therefore becoming essential tools in this data-driven hunt for new materials with novel properties, since they offer a means by which to create and curate molecular databases without requiring significant levels of user input. This ensures that well-founded concerns regarding data provenance, reproducibility, and replicability are mitigated. We have developed a versatile and flexible software package, PySoftK (Python Soft Matter at King’s College London) that provides flexible, automated computational workflows to create, model, and curate libraries of polymers with minimal user intervention. PySoftK is available as an efficient, fully tested, and easily installable Python package. Key features of the software include the wide range of different polymer topologies that can be automatically generated and its fully parallelized library generation tools. It is anticipated that PySoftK will support the generation, modeling, and curation of large polymer libraries to support functional materials discovery in the nanotechnology and biotechnology arenas.},

In this work, we expand upon the original concept and present a refined version of this software, termed mBuild, which is a general tool for constructing arbitrarily complex input configurations for molecular simulation in a programmatic fashion. Basic molecular components are connected using an equivalence operator which reduces and often removes the need for users to explicitly rotate and translate components as they assemble systems. Additionally, the programmatic nature of this approach and integration with the scientific Python ecosystem seamlessly exposes high-level variables that users can tune to alter the chemical composition of their systems, such as mixtures of polymers of different chain lengths and surface patterning. Leveraging these features, we demonstrate how mBuildserves as a stepping stone towards screening and performing optimizations in chemical parameter space of complex materials by performing automated screening studies of monolayer systems as a function of graft type, degree of polymerization, and surface density.},

	abstract = {A new coronavirus disease, SARS-CoV-2, has spread into a global pandemic in December 2019. Since no specific therapeutic drugs for treating COVID‐19 have been approved by FDA, recent studies suggest that the known antimalarial quinine and its derivatives (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) inhibit receptor binding of the viral particles and inhibits the strong “cytokine storm”, which is the main cause of death among infected patients. In particular, the natural alkaloid quinine has shown to possess a better safety profile and greater tolerability compared to its derivatives. Dosage optimization of quinine is still necessary as the currently available dosage forms have controversial pharmacokinetics and safety profiles. Therefore, repurposing quinine dosage forms to improve its pharmacokinetics and safety profile may be necessary to support its use against SARS-CoV-2. In this context, biodegradable/biocompatible polymeric nanoparticles may provide a safe site-specific and controlled quinine delivery, reducing the frequency of drug administration and the dose. In this study, a full atomistic molecular dynamics simulation approach has been used to investigate the use of poly-(glycolic acid) and poly-(lactic acid) and their copolymer poly-(lactic-co-glycolic acid) as potential delivery systems for lipophilic quinine to get insights into the mechanism of quinine encapsulation and release at the atomic/molecular level.},
